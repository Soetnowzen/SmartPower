Design decisions
================

## Design elements

### Slider

We decied to base our layout around sliding screens becuse it's used by a lot of other projects and looks nice.


## External dependencies motivations

### ActionBarSerlock

This library is used because we want to have an action bar for all supported targets

### ViewPagerIndicator

This library gives us the possibility of adding a title on each of the sliding fragments

### Robotium

For acceptance testing, we chose to use Robotium since it's easy to test the GUI using this library
