<h2 id="1">Which processes and practices did you use in your project?</h2>
git flow, version control, scrum, documentation, empirical process control, agile, refactoring, collective code ownership, simple design, design improvement and user stories. Some are subset of others but I wanted to highlight them specially.

<h2 id="2">Approximatey, how much time was spent (in total and by each group member) on the steps/activities involved as well as for the project as a whole?</h2>

| Name    | Git	|Pivot|Scrum	| Develop	| Research|error|

|Total	|21	|15	|42		|295		|43		|69	|
The sum of total becomes 485 hours.
It's hard to estimate as most worked independently at home and we were all doing different tasks, same had more experience in that field and some had easier tasks.

<h2 id="3">For each of the techniques and practices used in your project you should answer all the questions</h2>

Questions:

1 What was the advantage of this technique based on your experience in this assignment?

2 What was the disadvantage
###Git version control###
1 The advantages is many, multiple developers can contribute at the same time, can work at different geographical locations. Branching, everyone can code without interfering each other. Working offline, that you can revert to an arbitrary commit if you messed up
2 Maybe someone pushed an error but the advantages compensate for that thousandfold
3 Very efficient,  quite easy to use and it goes fast to learn the basics, from there you can expand your knowledge little by little
4 Every project
5 The exception would be small projects that only have one functionality
6 To be without version control is like not having electricity

###Scrum###
1 Advantage is that we have a pool we can choose our work from. Also because all our ideas was summarized on the pivotaltracker it helped me visualize the product, it's also a consistent way to get information
2 Didn't really understand the point system at first. The daily meetings I was forced to participate \*early\* in the morning, three meetings a week would have been sufficient. Short meetings, only 15 minutes they said, someone always had to pull a joke.
3 It was an efficient way to keep track of tasks and keep our priorities straight. In my other course that's where we failed a little. It gave us a slow start because some user stories distributed were dependent on others not yet implemented
4 Every project that has more than a few tasks. My favorite way to work is to write down all the tasks and then erase them one after another when finished. Scrum is all that
5 Depends on my teammates and how efficient the meetings would be. Also Im not to keen to have multiple website to visit to keep track with one project. Google drive, github, pivotaltracker.
6 In the end we worked so close to each other that we didnt use pivotal tracker instead we just requested each other directly in a loose form of scrum. Believe this was possible because of the small team size

5. We had problems with scrum in the beginning because some user stories was dependent on other tasks which someone else was developing, this lead to a slow start. Some minor information losses that could save time e.g. Coding a request that was already implemented in the API.
Too many scrum meetings and too early in the morning. Didn't understand why we persisted with this time as 1-3 members daily didn't show up to the meeting place in time, the members would participate using skype. Lastly is the task to implement user stories that depend on unimplemented functions someone else is developing. Maybe they should have developed the user story together, extreme programming, or one should have taken care of both tasks.

6. We knew eachother from before and overall it worked well, we even requested methods to be implemented to another.
7. I did like the concept of scrum and pivotal tracker but I want the feature to have user stories locked if they depend on a yet unimplemented task. So the only user stories are those we can work on in parallell. I have been thinking of the idea of having code roles, letting one developer be in charge of a group of classes.
