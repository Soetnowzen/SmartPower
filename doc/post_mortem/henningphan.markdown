<h2 id="1">Which processes and practices did you use in your project?</h2>
1. Which processes and practices did you use in your project?
2. Approximatey, how much time was spent (in total and by each 	group member) on the steps/activities involved as well as 	for the project as a whole?
3. For each of the techniques and practices used in your project you should answer all the questions:
	1. What was the advantage of this technique based on your 	experience in this assignment?
	2. What was the disadvantage of this technique based on your 	experience in this assignment?
	3. How efficient was the technique given the time it took to 	use?
	4.In which situations would you use this technique in a 	future project?
	5. In which situations would you not use this technique in a 	future project?
	6. If you had the practice/technique in a part of the 			project and not the entire project, how was using it 	compared to not using it?
4. What worked well in how you worked in this project?
5. What did not work well in how you worked in this project?
6. How did you work together as a group in the project? What worked and not in your interaction(s)?
7. What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

1. Processes and practices
git flow, version control, scrum, documentation, empirical process control, agile, refaktorering, collective code ownership, simple design, design improvement, user stories

2. It's hard to estimate as most worked independently at home and that we can't measure time based on commits.
these values are only estimates:
Andreas Arvidsson 125 h
Johan Bregell 100 h
Johan Swetzén 75 h
Henning Phan 100 h
Sebastian Lagerman 90 h

4. Scrum is good because everyone had their tasks and knew what they should do and by attending scrum meetings I knew what the group was doing which I feel is important because I personally put more effort into a project if I know my teammates puts in alot of effort. I also enjoyed to work with git which I have worked with in another project. As I mostly have been working in small groups the agile concept wasn't foregin to me but it's good to have the agile mindset as a team so everyone accepts the much needed refactoring in code.

5. We had problems with scrum in the beginning because some user stories was dependent on other tasks which someone else was developing, this lead to a slow start. Some minor information losses that could save time e.g. Coding a request that was already implemented in the API.
Too many scrum meetings and too early in the morning. Didn't understand why we persisted with this time as 1-3 members daily didn't show up to the meeting place in time, the members would participate using skype. Lastly is the task to implement user stories that depend on unimplemented functions someone else is developing. Maybe they should have developed the user story together, extreme programming, or one should have taken care of both tasks.

6. We knew eachother from before and overall it worked well, we even requested methods to be implemented to another.
7. I did like the concept of scrum and pivotal tracker but I want the feature to have user stories locked if they depend on a yet unimplemented task. So the only user stories are those we can work on in parallell. I have been thinking of the idea of having code roles, letting one developer be in charge of a group of classes. 
programmers have roles, bregell devApi
