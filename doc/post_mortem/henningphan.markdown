<h2 id="1">Which processes and practices did you use in your project?</h2>
git flow, version control, scrum, documentation, empirical process control, agile, refactoring, collective code ownership, simple design, design improvement and user stories. Some are subset of others but I wanted to highlight them specially.

<h2 id="2">Approximatey, how much time was spent (in total and by each group member) on the steps/activities involved as well as for the project as a whole?</h2>

|Total	|21	|15	|42		|295		|43		|69	|
The sum of total becomes 485 hours.
It's hard to estimate as most worked independently at home and we were all doing different tasks, same had more experience in that field and some had easier tasks.

<h2 id="3">For each of the techniques and practices used in your project you should answer all the questions<h2>
The questions:
	1. What was the advantage of this technique based on your experience in this assignment?
	2. What was the disadvantage of this technique based on your experience in this assignment?
	3. How efficient was the technique given the time it took to use?
	4.In which situations would you use this technique in a future project?
	5. In which situations would you not use this technique in a future project?
	6. If you had the practice/technique in a part of the project and not the entire project, how was using it compared to not using it?

4. Scrum was good to have when we became more comfortable with it. It gave me a good sense how far we were in the project, thanks to the many meetings. Another feature is you can pick a user story you are better suited for instead of having a boss managing that.
I also enjoyed to work with git which I have worked with in another project but it was only when we started doing this project we used the git model

5. We had problems with scrum in the beginning because some user stories was dependent on other tasks which someone else was developing, this lead to a slow start. Some minor information losses that could save time e.g. Coding a request that was already implemented in the API.
Too many scrum meetings and too early in the morning. Didn't understand why we persisted with this time as 1-3 members daily didn't show up to the meeting place in time, the members would participate using skype. Lastly is the task to implement user stories that depend on unimplemented functions someone else is developing. Maybe they should have developed the user story together, extreme programming, or one should have taken care of both tasks.

6. We knew eachother from before and overall it worked well, we even requested methods to be implemented to another.
7. I did like the concept of scrum and pivotal tracker but I want the feature to have user stories locked if they depend on a yet unimplemented task. So the only user stories are those we can work on in parallell. I have been thinking of the idea of having code roles, letting one developer be in charge of a group of classes. 
programmers have roles, bregell devApi
