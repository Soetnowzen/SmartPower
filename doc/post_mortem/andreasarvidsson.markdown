Post Mortem Report - Andreas Arvidsson
======================================

## Processes and practices
I've used a bunch of new processes and practices during the development of SmartPower. Some which I'm familiar with, some that are completely new.

### Git
Git is a tool I've been using for some time now. It has mostly been private projects to keep track of the changes I've made. I did not use a cool branching model or any advance features though. This course has taught me to do so, and I'm very pleased to have increased my proficiency at using this excellent tool.

#### Advantage
There's a great bunch of advantages using git, not only when developing as a team but also for individual use. First and foremost, it allows me to go back through all the commits to see what has been changed. This is very useful when something is not functioning correct, and you want to find out what (and who caused it, which is most of the times me). Not only this though, but you can easily keep track of all versions of the program (if using tags correctly), have access to the code base on all computers, synchronize code between collaborators, experiment with the code through branches, and much more.

#### Disadvantage
There are some minor disadvantages to git obviously. The most clear is that it adds a bit of overhead timewise, since every non-trivial change should be committed. There's also some conflicts that can occur when merging and rebasing which can be a bit tedious to solve. Also, every change is stored - which 

### Scrum
I have never worked on a larger project with someone else, so learning about scrum has been low priority for me until now. It has proven to be a very efficient tool.


### Unit and Acceptance testing
Testing is something I've also ignored in the past, but the importance of it is more clear now after this course.
