Post Mortem Report - Andreas Arvidsson
======================================

## Processes and practices
I've used a bunch of new processes and practices during the development of SmartPower. Some which I'm familiar with, some that are completely new.

### Git
Git is a tool I've been using for some time now. It has mostly been private projects to keep track of the changes I've made. I did not use a cool branching model or any advance features though. This course has taught me to do so, and I'm very pleased to have increased my proficiency at using this excellent tool.

### Scrum
I have never worked on a larger project with someone else, so learning about scrum has been low priority for me until now. It has proven to be a very efficient tool.


### Unit and Acceptance testing
Testing is something I've also ignored in the past, but the importance of it is more clear now after this course.
